This folder contains the pre-class learnings.


## Instructions

Save the summaries (mind map images and notes) for pre-class learnings in this folder. When adding a file, name it as `MMDD-short_title.png`, where `MM` is the month and `DD` is the day of the lesson. For instance, a mind map for the 'Types' lesson that covered on August 2nd would be named `0802-types.jpg`. To show all your images in one place, follow the example shown in the `pcl.md` file.  To preview a Markdown (.md) file, right click its over its name in the tab bar and select Open Preview.
